# reversi-react

Reversi game web page and very simple playing engine.

This project is a migration of plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript project to React.

This is a web page designed for playing the game of Reversi(Othello).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi

One can play against other player or Reversi engine(machine).

Features:
  - Play against other player or Reversi engine.
  - Pause the match and resume it at later stage.
  - Cancel the current match.
  - Automatically generated move list of the match.
  - Replay the moves of a concluded game using the move list.
  
#### Note:  
While the web page is full functioning, it is actually served as a resource for me
to have self traininig in web front-end development using React.
As a result the sources contain experiments and assignments intended just for a practice.

#### A word about the playing engine
The introduced playing engine is very simple one, designed only to allow a feature
of a match between a player and the machine, no more than this.
The engine even don't calculate moves forword, and consist of no more of 2-3 dozens
of lines of code.
